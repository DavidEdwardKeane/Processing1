Challenge 2

    Visit the Processing website and read up on the following keyEvents:
        keyPressed (boolean variable used to determine if a key was pressed).
        key (which stores a single alphanumeric character i.e. the most recently pressed key).

    In a new sketch, draw a cirlce if the C key was pressed and a rectangle if any other key was pressed.

    Test your codeâ€¦is the keyboard input case sensitive? Can you enter a lower case c to draw a circle?
